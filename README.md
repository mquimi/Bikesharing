# Bikesharing


### Overview of the statistical analysis:

Overall, we had to find a way to convince investiors that a bike-shairng program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. In order to gather information and create visulaization, we used Pandas and Tableau. Pandas was used to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype in the given dataset. Tableau was used to create visualizations that shows:

- How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders;
- How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders;
- A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

### Results:
 Below are a couple of results that were gathered.


[Checkout times for users](images/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Users.png)
 The majority of users check out between the first twenty minutes. This information tell us that the system would need to invest in high quantity if bikes to cover the demand. On the other hand, it could result in less repairs as trips are short.

[Checkout times by Gender](images/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Gender.png)
The difference between males and females is in terms of the number of users, as the trend keeps being very similar to the general one. Males tend to take slightly longer trips.

 Males seem to rely on the system for their transportation as most are subscribers. Most users of the system are subscribers, using it weekdays. Non-subscribers use it more during the weekend.

[Trips by Weekday per hour](images/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20for%20Each%20Hour.png)
During the weekdays, the trend shows us that people use the service to commute to and from work; however after work is when they used it more. Saturday is also the stronger day for bike users during the weekend.

[Trips by Gender](images/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png)
Males are clearly the majority of the system users, having the commute from work as the strongest time. For example, females represent 34% of the males' usage during the busier day, Thursday at 5 PM.
