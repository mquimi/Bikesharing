# Bikesharing


### Overview of the statistical analysis:

Overall, we had to find a way to convince investiors that a bike-shairng program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. In order to gather information and create visulaization, we used Pandas and Tableau. Pandas was used to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype in the given dataset. Tableau was used to create visualizations that shows:

- How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders;
- How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders;
- A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

### Results:
 Below are a couple of results that were gathered.

 The majority of users check out between the first twenty minutes. This information tell us that the system would need to invest in high quantity if bikes to cover the demand. On the other hand, it could result in less repairs as trips are short.

 Males seem to rely on the system for their transportation as most are subscribers. Most users of the system are subscribers, using it weekdays. Non-subscribers use it more during the weekend.
